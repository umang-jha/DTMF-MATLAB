## üîç Overview

This project implements a DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) decoder that can detect and decode telephone keypad tones in real-time. DTMF is the signaling method used by telephones to indicate which key has been pressed using a combination of two tones‚Äîone low frequency and one high frequency.

### Problem Statement
To build a MATLAB-based system that decodes DTMF tones captured through a microphone and reconstructs a complete phone number.

### Key Challenges Addressed
- Real-time signal capture and processing
- Accurate tone detection amid noise
- Reliable digit recognition with time constraints
- Detecting end of input using silence detection

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Audio Capture**: Captures audio signals from microphone input
- **DTMF Tone Detection**: Accurately identifies valid DTMF tone pairs
- **Digit Decoding**: Converts detected tones into corresponding keypad digits
- **Phone Number Reconstruction**: Displays complete phone number after silence detection
- **Noise Filtering**: Robust performance in various audio environments
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adaptive signal processing for improved accuracy

## üìû How DTMF Works

DTMF uses a 4√ó4 matrix system where each key generates two simultaneous tones:

### Frequency Matrix
| Key | Low Freq (Hz) | High Freq (Hz) |
|-----|---------------|----------------|
| 1   | 697           | 1209           |
| 2   | 697           | 1336           |
| 3   | 697           | 1477           |
| A   | 697           | 1633           |
| 4   | 770           | 1209           |
| 5   | 770           | 1336           |
| 6   | 770           | 1477           |
| B   | 770           | 1633           |
| 7   | 852           | 1209           |
| 8   | 852           | 1336           |
| 9   | 852           | 1477           |
| C   | 852           | 1633           |
| *   | 941           | 1209           |
| 0   | 941           | 1336           |
| #   | 941           | 1477           |
